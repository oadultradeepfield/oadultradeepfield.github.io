# oadultradeepfield

Hi! I'm Oad. I am an Astronomy Olympiad Medalist turned Computer Science major. Currently, I am focusing on two things I enjoy: building software that solves my everyday problems and creating interactive tools that help others learn advanced concepts with ease :)

On this website, I share my projects and cool findings I've encountered along my learning and building journeys.

This blog website was originally hosted in this [repository](https://github.com/oadultradeepfield/oadultradeepfield.github.io) and powered by Jekyll. The new website now runs on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Typo](https://tomfran.github.io/typo-wiki/) theme, created by [Francesco Tomaselli](https://tomfran.github.io/).
